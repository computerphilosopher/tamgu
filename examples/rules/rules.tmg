It was mediocre.
It was also bien.
- No Comparison... 
I can't say enough about this place.
It has "great sushi" and better mojito.
It has "great sushi" and even better service.
The cabernet sauvignon, from Napa Valley, was quite good.
The waiters were extremely accomodating and tended to my every need.
I've been to this restaurant over a dozen times with no complaints to date.

Overrated and not good. 
– I was highly disappointed in the food at Pagoda of East-Vietnam - .
The lemon chicken with almonds from the US that tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns, the few they actually give you.....were not good.
The prices are outrageous, especially since the food was actually less satisfying than most neighborhood Chinese establishments.
Nice ambience, but highly overrated place.
I will not go back.
The waiters were extremely accomodating and tended to my taste and to my need.
